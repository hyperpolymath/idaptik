# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in the Idaptik community a harassment-free, respectful, and emotionally safe experience for everyone.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Core Principles

### 1. Consent-Centered Collaboration

We follow **Consent-Centered Collaboration Protocol (CCCP)** principles:

- **Ask before engaging**: Respect people's time and boundaries
- **Accept "no" gracefully**: Rejection is not personal
- **Check in regularly**: Circumstances change, consent is ongoing
- **Respect different working styles**: Not everyone works the same way

### 2. Emotional Safety

We recognize that coding involves emotional labor:

- **Acknowledge stress**: Deadlines and bugs are genuinely stressful
- **Support, don't pressure**: Encourage without demanding
- **Celebrate small wins**: Progress matters regardless of size
- **Permit mistakes**: Errors are learning opportunities

### 3. Reversibility Mindset

Inspired by our project's core principle:

- **Changes are reversible**: Mistakes can be undone
- **Experimentation is safe**: Try things without fear
- **Iterate freely**: First drafts don't need to be perfect
- **Learn from reversals**: Undoing teaches as much as doing

## Our Standards

### Resources

If you're struggling:

## Community Values

### Type Safety of Collaboration

Just as ReScript's type system prevents runtime errors, our community norms prevent social errors:

- **Clear Contracts**: Expectations are explicit, not assumed
- **Sound Boundaries**: "No" is respected without exception
- **Compile-Time Checking**: Issues addressed early, not at "runtime"
- **No Null Surprises**: Communication is direct and honest

### Reversibility Principle

Inspired by our VM's core concept:

- **Mistakes are reversible**: Apologies and corrections are welcome
- **Experimentation is safe**: Try new approaches without fear
- **State can be restored**: Relationships can recover from conflict
- **Perfect undo exists**: Genuine apologies can reset to trust
